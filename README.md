# Music for Elite on the BBC Micro and BBC Master

This repository contains source code for a sideways ROM that plays the music from the Commodore 64 version of Elite, backported to run on the BBC Micro and BBC Master.

For more information on the musical version of BBC Elite which incorporates this ROM, see the [hacks section of the accompanying website](https://www.bbcelite.com/hacks/bbc_elite_with_music.html).

Build the BBC Micro ROM using `make`.

Build the BBC Master ROM using `make variant=master`.

The source contains various hard-coded variables that match the relevant version of Elite.

Right on, Commanders!
